Hey!

It would seem you stumbled across my personal project.

The plan for this project is to have a functional chat service built from scratch. I'm most likely going to focus primarily on the backend and make some shitty Frontend for testing purposes, etc.

I'd like to have an API for people to make their own frontends and not have to use my shitty one.

That's all for now I guess.

Idk
